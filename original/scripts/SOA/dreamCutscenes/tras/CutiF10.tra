@0   = ~You wake up damp with sweat. There is a faint ache wherever her fingers touched you, and when you bring your hand to your lips, your fingertips return with a faint ashen smudge.~
@1   = ~Another strange dream.

Imoen, or an image of her, showed up again last night. She was far more direct this time about the nature of our relationship, and once more the episode seemed to bleed into the waking world.
It's hard not to be concerned about their nature. They are so different from the dreams about the Taint. Perhaps her absence fills my head with strange thoughts, or perhaps she truly is reaching out to me.
I wonder if these dreams will keep happening until I reach her.~
