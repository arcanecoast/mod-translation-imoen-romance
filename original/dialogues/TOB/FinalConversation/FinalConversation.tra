@0    = ~You mean I could get rid of it voluntarily? Let it go, just like that?~
@1    = ~Yes, you may do so in this place. The Throne of Blood is at a finger's reach. Bhaal's essence is fluid and malleable here.~
@2    = ~It goes against everything <CHARNAME>'s been telling me, but... take it. Please take it, I don't want it, I never did.~
@3    = ~You mean I could get rid of it now, after everything I've dealt with? This sounds like a very bad joke.~
@4    = ~You may let it go in this place. The Throne of Blood is at a finger's reach. Bhaal's essence is fluid and malleable here.~
@5    = ~Are you nuts? It's as much mine as it is <CHARNAME>'s, I fought to control this damn thing! <CHARNAME>'s taught me not to run away from power. What happens if I keep it?~
@6    = ~Are you nuts? It's as much mine as it is <CHARNAME>'s. <PRO_HESHE>'s taught me not to run away from power, and Bhaal's power has shown me what I truly am. What happens if I keep it?~
@7    = ~That is for <CHARNAME> to decide. Your portion of Bhaal's essence is small enough not to affect <PRO_HISHER> options. <PRO_HESHE> may allow you to keep it, or may want to slay you for it.~
@8    = ~But know this. As long as you keep Bhaal's essence within you, you shan't know rest. You will be forever tethered to its divine power, with all the dangers such a thing entails. Should <CHARNAME> refuse his birthright, you will walk Toril as the last true Bhaalspawn.~
@9    = ~We'll see, then. I'd never go against your wishes, <CHARNAME>... but if this is going where I think it's going, we might have a pretty interesting arrangement in our hands.~
@10   = ~As you wish. The final decision approaches.~
@11   = ~But that would mean... (Imoen throws a fretful glance at you.)~
@12   = ~I think I know where all this is going. Maybe I could hold on to it awhile longer? What happens if I keep it?~
@13   = ~Your portion of Bhaal's essence is small enough not to affect <CHARNAME>'s options - yet beware, should you keep the Taint within you, your soul will be forever tethered to its divine power.~
@14   = ~That's... what I thought. We'll see, then.~
@15   = ~We might have fallen out, but I'll still miss you if you go. I was there to see this whole story start. It's strange to see it end, now...~
@16   = ~Good luck, whatever you do.~
@17   = ~I wish I could say I'll miss you, but... I don't think I will. Now that this is finally over, I won't ever have to deal with you again. At last I feel like my life is finally my own.~
@18   = ~<CHARNAME>...~ [IRDusk]
@19   = ~You were clear that this is what you wanted. I've been trying to get used to the idea ever since you told me... just live each day, enjoy what we have while it lasts. But now that we're here... it's much harder than I thought.~
@20   = ~I won't lie, I'd love it if you stayed - but I know this is your choice alone. Who wouldn't want to see the planes and play with the gods? After all that you've done to get here... I'd understand. I really would.~
@21   = ~If you go... I'll miss you forever. But I'll remember you fondly, and I'll even pray to you now and then. (Imoen's voice quavers slightly. She sniffles.) It'll be so weird.~
@22   = ~This is why I wanted to keep Bhaal's essence. You've taught me to live up to my potential. What if... what if we could stay together, somehow? You don't need to leave me behind. I dunno if I could be a Goddess with you, but... y'know, some kind of divine handmaiden? Maybe it could work. (She turns to the Solar.) Could it work?~
@23   = ~(The Solar regards Imoen in inscrutable silence, as if weighing possibilities and their consequences. Though only a moment passes, when the celestial being finally speaks you get the sense that it has put careful consideration in its next words.)~
@24   = ~There is a long, colorful history of consorts to deities, divine and mortal alike. The Taint you harbor could make such an arrangement possible in the astral planes. You would not have to remain confined to the mortal realms.~
@25   = ~Know that you would be forever bound to <CHARNAME>'s will and power. I advise you consider this carefully, Child of Bhaal.~
@26   = ~(Imoen looks back at you. There is a doubtful mien on her face.) That sounds... complicated.~
@27   = ~Well, if there's a time to be honest, it's right now. I love you, <CHARNAME>, but... I dunno if I'd trust you with my whole eternity. No offense.~
@28   = ~Forget about it, then. Take the Taint away, take it and do with it whatever you like. In the end it's still a hateful thing that I shouldn't have anything to do with.~
@29   = ~(Imoen looks back at you. There is a small grin on her lips, full of trepidation.) I'm willing to pay the price.~
@30   = ~So be it.~
@31   = ~This is why I wanted to keep Bhaal's essence. I never thought I would feel this way about anyone. The thought of losing you has been tearing me apart... so, maybe - maybe there's a way we could... go together? Somehow? I dunno if I could be a goddess, but... y'know, some kind of divine handmaiden? (She turns to the Solar.) Is that possible?~
@32   = ~There is a long, colorful history of consorts to deities, divine and mortal alike. The Taint you harbor could make such an arrangement possible in the astral planes; the bond you share might even enable you to ascend to godhood alongside <CHARNAME>. Either way, you do not need to remain confined to the mortal realms.~
@33   = ~Know that regardless of the choice, you would be forever bound to <CHARNAME>'s power. Should you attempt to attain godhood together, <PRO_HESHE> will be irrevocably bound to yours. You will be linked, in body, mind and spirit. I advise you consider this carefully, Children of Bhaal.~
@34   = ~(Imoen looks back at you. There is a nervous grin on her lips.) What do you say, <CHARNAME>? I'll do my best no matter what. We've gone through too much, I love you *too much* to lose you now. Tell me you feel the same way.~
@35   = ~In the back of my head, I've kept wondering what you'd do once we got here. I know you haven't said you'd go, but I worried all the same. I mean, who wouldn't want to see the planes? After all the work you've done... who wouldn't be tempted to see things through to their proper end? I've been trying not to think about it, just live each day and enjoy what we have while it lasts. But now that we're here... it's much harder than I thought.~
@36   = ~I won't lie, I'd love it if you stayed - but I know this is your choice alone. How would I feel, knowing that you gave up godhood for me? Would you resent me, eventually? Would you even grow to hate me? I couldn't live with that.~
@37   = ~I want you to choose what you want, what you feel is *right*. And if you go... I'll miss you forever. But I'll remember you fondly, and I'll even pray to you now and then. (Imoen's voice quavers slightly. She sniffles.) It'll be so weird.~
@38   = ~This is why I wanted to keep Bhaal's essence, just in case. You've taught me to live up to my potential. What if... what if we could stay together, somehow? If you choose to claim Bhaal's power, you don't have to leave me behind. I dunno if I could be a goddess with you, but... y'know, some kind of divine handmaiden? Maybe it could work. (She turns to the Solar.) Could it work?~
@39   = ~This is why I wanted to keep Bhaal's essence. I never thought I would feel this way about anyone. I hear the choice that's before you, and the thought of losing you is just too much. If you really want to claim Bhaal's power, maybe - maybe there's a way we could... go together? Somehow? I dunno if I could be a goddess, but... y'know, some kind of divine handmaiden? (She turns to the Solar.) Is that possible?~
@40   = ~(Imoen looks back at you. There is a nervous grin on her lips.) How about that? No matter what you choose, we don't have to go separate ways. Together since the beginning, and together to the end of time, if that's what you want. (Imoen's voice quavers. Tears have welled in her eyes.) We've gone through too much... I love you *too much* to lose you now. Tell me you feel the same way.~
@41   = ~(Imoen is looking at you with worry. She doesn't seem capable of maintaining eye contact for long.)~
@42   = ~If there's a time to be truthful and honest... well, that's now, isn't it. (She takes a deep breath and lets it go slowly.)~
@43   = ~I love you, <CHARNAME>. I think I always will. But... I see you standing here, destiny itself unfolding before you, and I find myself outside of it. It's... revelatory. The truth is that I don't want to be part of this decision.~
@44   = ~We've been together from the start, and now... I think I'm done. We got here. It's over. I don't wanna do it anymore.~
@45   = ~You're free, now. Go where you will and... I'll do the same.~
@46   = ~Wait... are you breaking up with me? Now?~
@47   = ~I couldn't have said it better. I understand what you're saying, Imoen. Thank you for everything.~
@48   = ~But I was planning to stay with you! I'll be the <PRO_MANWOMAN> you deserve, now that it's all over!~
@49   = ~Things haven't worked between us for a while. I'm glad you see it as I do.~
@50   = ~Yeah... I guess I am.~
@51   = ~How DARE you, after everything I've done for you!~
@52   = ~Just making sure I understood you correctly. I agree, then. Things haven't worked between us for a while.~
@53   = ~Is it because I haven't treated you well enough? I've been so stressed! Now I can finally be the person you want me to be!~
@54   = ~I know. I'm sorry.~
@55   = ~Do you want me to explain, or shut up?~
@56   = ~Explain yourself, it's the least that you owe me.~
@57   = ~Just be quiet, I can't believe you're doing this right now.~
@58   = ~I owe you much more than that... I owe you everything. But romantically, I can't do this anymore. It's taken me this long to realize... we're not meant for one another.~
@59   = ~So I imagine what will happen with each of your options - if you go, we had a clean break. Nothing left unsaid, no regrets. If you stay... I can't bear the thought of sticking together, an ex-girlfriend hanging around like she's got nothing better. Sure, I don't *have* anything better. You are my whole life. And when I think about that... I want to change it.~
@60   = ~So that's where we're at right now. I hope it makes sense.~
@61   = ~I'll miss you, <CHARNAME>. Who knows, maybe if you stay I'll show up to save yer bacon again one day.~
@62   = ~Yeah. I'm sorry, for what it's worth.~
@63   = ~(Though she smiles, tears have welled in her eyes.) Yeah. I'll miss you a lot anyway, you know? I owe you so much, and we've come so far...~
@64   = ~But it's the right decision. Whatever you choose, we need to part ways. At least for a while.~
@65   = ~Who knows, maybe if you stay I'll show up to save yer bacon again one day.~
@66   = ~No, <CHARNAME>. It's not about that. We're not meant for each other, I see it now. You'll understand where I'm coming from, with time.~
@67   = ~Yeah. I'll miss you a lot anyway, you know? (Tears have welled in Imoen's eyes.) I owe you so much, and we've come so far, but... it's the right decision. Whatever you choose, we need to part ways. At least for a while.~
@68   = ~If there's something I've learned with you is to stop trying to hold back my potential. You taught me to use the Taint, and accept myself for who I am and what I really want... and I'm standing here, looking at you and the decision you're about to make - and it's just amazing. That's why I wanted to keep Bhaal's essence. I want to see the planes too. I want to bicker with the gods. If you're doing this, I want to go with you, <CHARNAME>.~
@69   = ~I so wish you'd reconsider...~
@70   = ~I'm sorry, Aerie. I need to take this chance. It probably won't work, but I gotta try. (She addresses you once more.)~
@71   = ~Don't get me wrong, I don't want *your* place, I'm not jealous or anything like that... I just want to continue helping you. Like, y'know, some kind of divine handmaiden? (She turns to the Solar.) Is that possible?~
@72   = ~Yours is the same divine spark that fuels <CHARNAME>'s claim to <PRO_HISHER> birthright. The Taint you harbor could make such an arrangement possible in the astral planes. You need not remain in the mortal realms.~
@73   = ~Know that, if you do this, you would be forever bound to <CHARNAME>'s will and power. I advise you consider this carefully, Child of Bhaal.~
@74   = ~Well, if there's a time to be honest, it's right now. I love you plenty, <PRO_BROTHERSISTER>, but... I dunno if I'd trust you with my whole eternity. No offense.~
@75   = ~Forget about it, then. Take the Taint away, take it and do with it whatever you like. In the end it's still a hateful thing that I shouldn't have anything to do with. I'll find things to do with myself in the mortal world, I'm sure.~
@76   = ~(Imoen looks back at you. There is a small grin on her lips, full of trepidation.) And what's new? Been at <PRO_HISHER> beck and call for years, it's all I've ever done. Might as well make it official.~
@77   = ~Wow.~
@78   = ~I'm sorry, Imoen. You must stay behind.~
@79   = ~I want you to come with me, Imoen. We belong together, for all eternity.~
@80   = ~I'll be ruthless, Imoen. I will turn the celestial rules on their head and run all my opponents into the ground. Are you sure you want to join me?~
@81   = ~I'll be ruthless, Imoen. Assassinations, betrayals, torture, whatever it takes to get me ahead. Are you sure you want to join me?~
@82   = ~I'll be ruthless, Imoen. I will spread ruin and misery, and mortals will cower at the mention of my name. Are you sure you want to join me?~
@83   = ~Did I make the right choice? I'll reconsider if you believe I should.~
@84   = ~I want you to come with me, Imoen. We belong together, after all.~
@85   = ~Godhood isn't for me, after all. I would much rather spend the rest of my mortal life with you.~
@86   = ~Godhood isn't for me, but how about you, Last Living Bhaalspawn? I don't want Bhaal's essence. You can do with it what you will.~
@87   = ~Come with me, Imoen. Together we will be unstoppable.~
@88   = ~Godhood isn't for me, after all. Time to go live our lives at last, Imoen.~
@89   = ~I can't blame you, it's what you always wanted... (Despite her efforts, tears escape her eyelids and stream down her cheeks. She wipes at them in frustration, trying to smile.)~
@90   = ~I can't blame you, I really can't... (Despite her efforts, tears escape her eyelids and stream down her cheeks. She wipes at them in frustration, trying to smile.)~
@91   = ~I'm sorry. I'd even started daydreaming about my wedding dress. I knew it was a silly thing to think about.~
@92   = ~I'll miss you so much. Make me proud up there, <CHARNAME>. Don't do anything I wouldn't do.~
@93   = ~You changed your mind! (Imoen throws herself into your arms, squeezing you tightly.)~
@94   = ~(Imoen throws herself into your arms, squeezing you tightly.)~
@95   = ~You're staying, I'm so happy, SO happy! After all this, we're going to end up on the road again.~
@96   = ~It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep! I can't wait!~
@97   = ~I'm so glad all the silly daydreaming I've been doing about my wedding dress didn't go to waste...~
@98   = ~What? But... we could...~
@99   = ~Why? I thought we were just perfect together. You don't feel that way? Help me understand...~
@100  = ~I don't wish this fate for you, Imoen. You belong in the mortal realm. Trust me in this.~
@101  = ~I love you so very dearly, but... eternity together? That is more of a commitment than anyone should make.~
@102  = ~I hate to break it to you, but I don't feel nearly as strongly about you as you feel about me.~
@103  = ~This is *my* birthright, and I will share it with no-one, not even you.~
@104  = ~My reasons are my own. This is my will, and you must accept it.~
@105  = ~I... see. I guess... I guess I could... understand. With time.~
@106  = ~I was a fool to hope for this. It was such a long shot... (Despite her best efforts, tears escape her eyelids and stream down her cheeks. She wipes at them in frustration.)~
@107  = ~There's no point to any of this then, if you don't want to. Take my Bhaal essence, do what you were destined to do. I'll just... let you go...~
@108  = ~(Imoen gives in to the tears. She faces away from you, hugging herself, waiting for the inevitable.)~
@109  = ~Wow. I... wow.~
@110  = ~That's... alright, then. (Imoen is blinking profusely, her eyes not quite knowing where to focus.) I don't... I don't know how to deal with this.~
@111  = ~What am I even doing, then? There's no point to any of it. I was such a fool to hope for this... (Despite her best efforts, tears escape her eyelids and stream down her cheeks. She wipes at them in frustration.)~
@112  = ~Take my Bhaal essence, do whatever you want. I'll just... I need a moment.~
@113  = ~I... see. I thought... maybe you wouldn't care. But I should've known. I should've known...~
@114  = ~I was a fool to hope for this. I know you better than that. (Despite her best efforts, tears escape her eyelids and stream down her cheeks. She wipes at them in frustration.)~
@115  = ~Oh, gods. This is real. It's really going to happen. (Imoen throws herself into your arms, squeezing you tightly.)~
@116  = ~This is... *so* terrifying. But I'm ready. If there's anything I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together.~
@117  = ~As you wish, though it brings me no pleasure to unleash such an evil onto the cosmos. You are wicked, Bhaalspawn, and your time as a power will be a difficult one, I swear. Perhaps Imoen's influence will temper your ruthlessness, yet I very much doubt it. She will very likely mold to your ways.~ [SOLAR103]
@118  = ~As you wish... though the thought of you succumbing to the temptations of Bhaal's foul taint brings me no pleasure. We shall see what manner of power you become... in time. Perhaps Imoen's influence shall tip the scales in favor of righteousness, mischief-riddled as it may be.~ [SOLAR104]
@119  = ~As you wish. You have proven to us all that the power in your blood is yours to command... it does not command you. I shall be proud to stand by you in a place of power among the heavens. Imoen's influence should only reinforce your righteousness, mischief-riddled as it may become.~ [SOLAR105]
@120  = ~YES! (Imoen throws herself into your arms, squeezing you tight.)~
@121  = ~I'll admit, the thought of going with you was *terrifying*. But I was ready. If there's anything I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together.~
@122  = ~I'm SO happy to stay, though. Oh, this is so great, I can hardly believe it's happening... it's over, <CHARNAME>, it's all over at last, and we're gonna be on the road again. It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep, I can't wait! I even have a wedding to plan, oh boy...~
@123  = ~I'm SO happy to stay, though. Oh, this is so great, I can hardly believe it's happening... it's over, <CHARNAME>, it's all over at last, and we're gonna be on the road again. It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep, I can't wait!~
@124  = ~Solar, please, take this gross Bhaal essence away. We don't want it. I can't wait to forget all about it.~
@125  = ~What? No... this is about what *you* think is right. You can't make this decision based on what I want. When it comes to this, that shouldn't matter.~
@126  = ~How can you say that? You are part of me. I will always have your wishes in mind.~
@127  = ~What's right? I want to be happy by your side. You know what makes me happy? Making *you* happy. So, yes, I need to know which life you'd rather have.~
@128  = ~And have you resent me a couple centuries down the line? No, I need you to be just as certain as I am about this.~
@129  = ~I see. Then I'm sorry, Imoen. You must stay behind.~
@130  = ~Come with me, then. We belong together, for all eternity.~
@131  = ~Fine, then. I do not want the essence of Bhaal. Let us remain mortal.~
@132  = ~(Imoen chuckles lightly.) Even at a time like this, you still find the exact right thing to say.~
@133  = ~Alright, then, how about this: I won't tell you what you should choose, but I'll tell you what *I'd* choose if I were in your shoes and had no-one else to think about.~
@134  = ~The truth is that I'd let go of Bhaal's essence and stay mortal. Becoming a new god sounds like the beginning of another huge struggle. At this point, I feel like we've struggled long enough.~
@135  = ~But like I said... I want to be with you. Go or stay, this is what I want. Don't you get it, <CHARNAME>? That's what I've always wanted, to help you, to support you in every way. The way I feel when I'm with you, I can't feel it anywhere else.~
@136  = ~I *am* certain. I want to be with you. Go or stay, this is what I want. Don't you get it, <CHARNAME>? That's what I've always wanted, to help you, to support you in every way. The way I feel when I'm with you, I can't feel it anywhere else.~
@137  = ~I love you more than I can say. Mortal or God, it doesn't matter to me.~
@138  = ~I...~
@139  = ~I've been watching you do these things all this time. I've helped you, feeling bad all the while, but I helped anyway. I stuck around and followed your steps, whatever terrible places you went. I made love to you knowing the kind of person you are. You do what you do and still... I love you more than I can say.~
@140  = ~What does that say about me? I like to be nice to people, but maybe, deep down... I don't care. As long as I'm happy, as long as you treat me the way you do, I don't care.~
@141  = ~And now we stand in this place, and I look at the two paths before me. Go separate ways and find a life of my own. Stay with you and keep doing terrible things. One is the right thing to do, while the other makes me happy.~
@142  = ~I want to be with you. I'll do what it takes. Mortal or god, it makes no difference.~
@143  = ~I see. (Shake your head.) I'm sorry, Imoen. You must stay behind.~
@144  = ~I'm glad you feel this way. Come with me, then. We belong together, for all eternity.~
@145  = ~Wow, really? But... we could've made it work...~
@146  = ~Why? I thought this is what you wanted. We have something beautiful together. You don't feel that way? Help me understand...~
@147  = ~That's... alright, then. I didn't see that coming.~
@148  = ~(Imoen is blinking profusely, her eyes not quite knowing where to focus.) I don't... I don't know how to deal with this.~
@149  = ~Oh, gods. This is real. This is really happening. (Imoen throws herself into your arms, squeezing you tight.)~
@150  = ~This is... *so* terrifying. But I'm ready. If there's anything I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together. I won't hold back. I'm going to become the absolute very best I can become. I'll be your right hand and do you proud.~
@151  = ~You changed your mind?~
@152  = ~This is so weird, I'd have thought...~
@153  = ~Wait, wait - and you are leaving this in *my* hands? Are you nuts?~
@154  = ~What do you say, Imoen? Fancy being a goddess? Once in a lifetime opportunity. Go for it, I won't resent you at all.~
@155  = ~Somebody needs to fill this void, and it will not be me. Fulfil this duty, Imoen. Perhaps you were fated to inherit Bhaal's throne after all.~
@156  = ~I'm staying. Now the choice is up to you.~
@157  = ~Me? A goddess...~
@158  = ~(Imoen grows quiet, her lips parted slightly. You can watch the possibility slowly becoming real on her features.)~
@159  = ~No... no, there's no way. We'd have to go separate ways, for one. And it sounds like such a huge hassle. I'm done struggling, I think. I don't wanna be ripped apart by a pissed off pantheon.~
@160  = ~Only a mad<PRO_MANWOMAN> would go for it - and since not even you are willing to do it, well, that tells me something right there, hah!~
@161  = ~I'm happy to stay with you. Actually... I'm REALLY happy to stay. It's hard to believe... it's over, <CHARNAME>, it's all over at last, and we're gonna be on the road again. It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep, isn't that crazy?~
@162  = ~Solar, please, take this gross Bhaal essence away. I wish I'd never touched it. I can't wait to forget all about it.~
@163  = ~You *are* nuts!~
@164  = ~It's so weird that you changed your mind in the end, after everything you said. I thought for sure you'd go for it...~
@165  = ~Oh, wow, really? I thought for sure you'd go for it...~
@166  = ~I'll admit, the thought of going through with the whole ascension thing was *terrifying*. But I was ready. If there's anything I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together.~
@167  = ~I'm happy to stay, though. Actually... I'm REALLY happy to stay. It's hard to believe... it's over, <CHARNAME>, it's all over at last, and we're gonna be on the road again. It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep. I even have a wedding to plan, oh boy...~

@169  = ~I've been watching you do these things all this time. I've helped you, feeling bad all the while, but I helped anyway. I stuck around and followed your steps, whatever terrible places you went, and listened to your advice knowing full well where it would lead me.~
@170  = ~I made love to you knowing the kind of person you are. You do what you do and still... I love you more than I can say. What does that say about me? I like to be nice to people, but maybe, deep down... I don't care. As long as I'm happy, as long as you treat me the way you do, I don't care.~
@171  = ~And now we stand in this place, and I look at the two paths before me. Go separate ways and find a life of my own. Stay with you and keep gaining power doing terrible things. One is the right thing to do, while the other makes me happy.~
@172  = ~I want to see how far I can go, and I want to be with you. I'll do what it takes.~
@173  = ~I'm glad you feel this way. Come with me, then. We belong together, after all.~
@174  = ~Psh, figures. All of it for yourself, what a shocker. I don't get it, you could have an excellent right hand by your side. I mean... I dunno about everything else, but I think I've got trustworthy and loyal down pat.~
@175  = ~But hey, it's always been up to you. Take this gross Bhaal essence then, I sure don't wanna keep it. If I'd had a choice, it would've been gone a long time ago.~
@176  = ~Hah! I thought for a moment you were leaving me behind. Wow, we're really doing this. It's terrifying!~
@177  = ~I'm ready, though. If there's something I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together. I won't hold back. I'm going to become the absolute very best I can become. I'll be your right hand and do you proud.~
@178  = ~This is so weird, I thought for sure you'd go for it. I'll admit, the thought of ascending with ya was *terrifying*... but I was ready. If there's anything I've learned through all this, it's that we can face anything as long as we're together.~
@179  = ~I'm happy to stay, to be honest. It's hard to believe... it's all over at last, and we're gonna be on the road again. It'll be the first time we'll be able to pick our path since we left Candlekeep, isn't that crazy?~
@180  = ~I've been watching you do these things all this time. I've helped you, feeling bad all the while, but I helped anyway. I stuck around and followed your steps, whatever terrible places you went, and listened to your advice knowing full well where it would lead me. Everything you've done, everything *we've* done... I'm just as much to blame.~
@181  = ~What does that say about me? I like to be nice to people, but maybe, deep down... I don't care. I stand in this place, looking at the two paths before me. Go separate ways and find a life of my own. Stay with you and keep gaining power doing terrible things. One is the right thing to do, while the other... the other is what I actually want.~
@182  = ~I want to see how far I can go. I'll do what it takes. I can do it, as long as I'm with you.~
@183  = ~I see. Even so, I'm sorry, Imoen. You must stay behind.~
@184  = ~Excellent, I'm glad you feel this way. Come with me, then. Together we will be unstoppable.~
@185  = ~I didn't expect you to stay. I suppose we'll be saying our goodbyes soon enough, then...~
@186  = ~So you're going to stay a mortal? Wow, after all that, we're going to end up on the road again! Must feel good, though, to have your own future ahead of you again, though. No?~ [IMOE2525]
@187  = ~I mean, if you don't mind me sticking around, still. With... our history an' all. It'll be fun to set our path, for once.~
@188  = ~It'll be strange not traveling with you anymore. Good luck, for what it's worth.~
@189  = ~Well, Good luck, <CHARNAME>. I'll miss ya... although somehow I just know we'll see each other again. Maybe I'll getcha out of trouble again... ya never know!~ [IMOE2526]
@190  = ~Well, I guess it's what I thought you'd do. I'm glad we sorted things out before you left. Good luck, <CHARNAME>. I mean it.~
